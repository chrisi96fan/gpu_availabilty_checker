# gpu_availabilty_checker

This is a small script that checks the availability of certain products, specifically RTX 5090 GPUs, using browser automation with the Selenium library. 

When a product becomes available, it sends a notification via Telegram. 

For the store Alternate, the script can automatically add the product to the shopping cart and extract a specific cookie to reserve the item.

Note: I havenâ€™t updated or tested the script since March 2025, so functionality is not guaranteed.
